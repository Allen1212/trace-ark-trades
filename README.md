# trace-ark-trades

This project records all purchases and sales made by [ARK Invest](https://ark-invest.com/) from 11/12/2019 to the present and utilizes [Pine script](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/index.html) to visualize these trades in [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com). It includes trade records of 251 stocks. 
Through analyzing these trades, I think it's an excellent beginning to investigate how ARK invests and build your own investing system.

## Data sources

I [downloaded]((https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/trades/ARK_Trades.pdf)) trade data from 11/12/2019 - 11/11/2020.
 From 11/12/2020 to the present, I collected the trade records via subscribing to ARK's trade notifications. 
 You can subscribe to the services from [here](https://ark-funds.com/subscribe). ARK will email its trading log to you daily.

## Instructions

## Thank you

I got inspired by a video made by this [Youtuber](https://youtu.be/DfSRNcCbEpA). I follow his idea to finish this project. He did lots of awesome videos to analyze the company's finances and introduce math knowledge behind the stock indicator. If you'd like to learn how to invest, I strongly recommend you to subscribe to his youtube channel.
