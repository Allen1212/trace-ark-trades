# trace-ark-trades

This project records all purchases and sales made by ARK Invest from 11/12/2019 to the present and utilizes pine script to visualize these trades in TradingView. It includes trade records of 251 stocks. Through analyzing these trades, I think it's a good beginning to explore how ARK invests and builds your own investing system.

## Instructions

I will use Tesla Inc (TSLA) as an example to show how to use this project.

## Thank you

I got inspired by a video made by this [Youtuber](https://youtu.be/DfSRNcCbEpA). I follow his idea to finish this project. He did lots of awesome videos to analyze the company's finances and introduce math knowledge behind the stock indicator. If you'd like to learn how to invest, I strongly recommend you to subscribe to his youtube channel.
